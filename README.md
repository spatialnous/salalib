# Sala, the spatial analysis library

This is a C++17 spatial network analysis library originally part of [Depthmap](https://github.com/SpaceGroupUCL/Depthmap) and [depthmapX](https://github.com/SpaceGroupUCL/depthmapX).
It has been split off to make it easier to include into other projects and it currently powers:
- [depthmapX](https://github.com/spatialnous/depthmapX): A fork of depthmapX that follows the development of salalib
- [alcyon](https://github.com/spatialnous/alcyon): An R package to do Spatial Network Analysis.

The library is also extensively tested in the [gensalatest](https://github.com/spatialnous/gensalatest) repository. 

Consider [supporting my work](https://github.com/sponsors/pklampros) in the development of this library!

## Development:
Make sure that git hooks are enabled, to avoid committing minor issues:

```{bash}
git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks/
```
